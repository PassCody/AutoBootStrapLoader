# AutoBootStrapLoader
This is an example how to Automatically Load BootStrap in your Projects.


# Infos
The Direcotry "Libarys" needs to be in your main folder of your project/s.
From here on, you only need to copy the index.php and init.php in your Folders.

# Hint
Do not edit the index.php and the bootstrap_loader.php. Otherwise you can crash the loader and it won't work any more.
