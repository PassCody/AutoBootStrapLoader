# AutoBootStrapLoader
This is an example how to Automatically Load BootStrap in your Projects.


# Infos
The Direcotry "Libarys" needs to be in your main folder of your project/s.
From here on, you only need to copy the index.php and init.php in your Folders.

# Hint
Do not edit the index.php and the bootstrap_loader.php. Otherwise you can crash the loader and it won't work any more.


# About this Repository
I am the writer for the AutBootStrapLoader "AddIn". I don't work on the BootStrap repository myself. I just want to give BootStrap itself and others the opportunity to integrate the framework into their projects without problems. It is therefore not my intention to sell or otherwise harm the makers of Bootstrap their code as mine.
